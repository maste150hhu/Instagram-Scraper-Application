# This project just began. Thus it has no real functionality and I am working with random data

# What is this project for?
With the Instagram Scraper Application I want to reimplement
the Instagram Basic API. Since Facebook made it really hard 
for me to receive an access token to use their API, I did
some research and found programmers who reverse-engineered
the API which resulted in myself trying to do so too.

## TODO
+ add animations for the search results
+ add profile pictures for search results
+ write subproject "Scraper" which offers a lot of tools to
  parse Instagram Profile Objects
